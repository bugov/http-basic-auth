# http-basic-auth

Yep, it's one more HTTP Basic Auth python lib. The second. And I tried
to use the first, but it had a bug (which I fixed) and... completely
wrong realisation of non-latin encoding/decoding.

Also it supports only RFC-2617, but RFC-7617 is actual.

I want to implement full HTTP Basic Auth protocol, but I'll start from
RFC-2617 version.
